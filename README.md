# Compressible-Fluid-Dynamics python and MATLAB simulation
Hi guys!

Thanks for joining us for Chulalongkorn University's Compressible Fluid Dynamics (2103-566) course. This is a hands-on, portfolio-based course. The course is built with an open-source license so after you fork the repository it's yours! 

This repository is a collection of computational modules in mechanical engineering for undergraduate students who are interested in compressible fluid dynamics. These materials are a combination of work from Asst. Prof Asi B. at Chulalongkorn University Mechanical Engineering Department and Me, Pakorn Boonpetch.

The course content:
  Thermodynamics of motion; Physical acoustics; wave equation; speed of sound; quasi-one-dimensional flow with friction and heat addition; shock waves and related discontinuities; one-dimensional unsteady flow; two-dimensional steady flow; method of characteristics; nozzle design
